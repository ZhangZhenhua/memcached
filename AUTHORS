# zhangzh: Brad developped groupcache which is another
# memcached written in Go. It drops some features like
# expire time and expire item reclycling, which means
# cached items will never expire. This enables some other
# rich features like hot item cacheing/replication.
# Groupcache is now used in multiple projects in Google.
